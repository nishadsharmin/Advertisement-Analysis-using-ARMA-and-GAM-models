# Advertisement-Analysis-using-ARMA-and-GAM-models
Find the best performing ad groups and predict future performance

Problem Statement - 

1. If you had to identify the 5 best ad groups, which ones would they be? Which metric did you choose to identify the best ad groups? 
2. Why? Explain the pros of your metric as well as the possible cons.


KPI Identified-

1. Profit: Total revenue
  Pros: the end goal for a company's ad is profit 
  Cons: could easily be skewed by sale of 1 item that is high revenue
  
2. Good ads placement/fit - shown vs. clicked (i.e. click-through-rate)
Pros: Evaluate the performance of each ad to attract the user to explore it further.
Cons: It does not account for profitability, and there is still a disconnect between the actual purchase.

3. Positive recommendation - clicked vs. converted/purchased (i.e. conversion rate)
Pros: Measures how effectively the targeting of the ad was in terms of convincing a purchase.
Cons: Introduces bias based on type of item. Customers are more inclined to impulsively purchase a cheap item than expensive on.

Used to K-Means to cluster ads into 3 groups based on performance
